      <description>Introduction In my last post I introduced the DonorsChoose dataset, which can be easily downloaded from Kaggle. This dataset is fun to play with because it has lots of natural language processing (NLP) potential. Each observation contains (among other things) essays written by classroom teachers. Just like in my last post, we’ll focus on the essays here.
This time, we’ll explore the teacher essays using word embeddings. Word embeddings are a mathematical representation of word similarity (e.</description>

Here’s a photo of me and a student (circa 2012) playing with our crowd-funded rockets:
